## AWS EFS CSI Driver
###

The [Amazon Elastic File System](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver implements [CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) interface for container orchestrators to manage lifecycle of Amazon EFS volumes.

This driver is in alpha stage. Basic volume operations that are functional include NodePublishVolume/NodeUnpublishVolume.

## Features
Currently only static provisioning is supported. This means a AWS EFS filesystem needs to be created manually on AWS first. After that it could be mounted inside container as a volume using AWS EFS CSI Driver.

### Encryption In Transit
One of the advantages of using EFS is that it provides [encryption in transit](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-encryption-of-data-in-transit-for-amazon-efs/) support using TLS. Using encryption in transit, data will be encrypted during its transition over the network to EFS service. This provides extra layer of depth-in-depth for applications that requires higher secuity compliance.

To enable encryption in transit, `tls` needs to be set at `NodePublishVolumeRequest.VolumeCapability.MountVolume` object's `MountFlags` fields. For example of using it in kuberentes, see persistence volume manifest in [Example](#kubernetes-example)

**Note** Kubernetes version 1.13 and above is required if you are using this feature in Kuberentes.

# Kubernetes Example
This example demos how to make a EFS filesystem mounted inside container using the driver. Before this, get yourself familiar with setting up kubernetes on AWS and [creating EFS filesystem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/getting-started.html). And when creating EFS filesystem, make sure it is accessible from kuberenetes cluster. This can be achieved by creating EFS filesystem inside the same VPC as kubernetes cluster or using VPC peering.

Deploy AWS EFS CSI driver:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-efs-csi-driver/master/deploy/kubernetes/controller.yaml 
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-efs-csi-driver/master/deploy/kubernetes/node.yaml
```

Edit the [persistence volume manifest file](../deploy/kubernetes/sample_app/pv.yaml) (note that encryption in transit is enabled using mount option):
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: efs-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
  storageClassName: efs-sc
  mountOptions:
    - tls
  csi:
    driver: efs.csi.aws.com
    volumeHandle: [FileSystemId] 
```
Replace `VolumeHandle` with `FileSystemId` of the EFS filesystem that needs to be mounted. You can find it using AWS CLI:

```
aws efs describe-file-systems 
```

Then create PV, persistence volume claim (PVC) and storage class:
```
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/sample_app/storageclass.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/sample_app/pv.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/sample_app/claim.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/sample_app/pod.yaml
```

After the objects are created, verify that pod name app is running:

```
kubectl get pods
```

Also you can verify that data is written onto EFS filesystem:

```
kubectl exec -ti app -- tail -f /data/out.txt
```

## Development
Please go through [CSI Spec](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) and [General CSI driver development guideline](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/Development.html) to get some basic understanding of CSI driver before you start.

### Requirements
* Golang 1.11.2+
